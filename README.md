# Let's get started, introduction and documentation

## How did it all start?

October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:

## Blockchain and Hyperledger : http://hyperledger.org/**

Hyperledger, an open source collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies, 
is hosted by The Linux Foundation®. 

Deployed in Docker images.

1. A blockchain emulates a “trusted” computing service through a distributed protocol, 
   run by nodes connected over the Internet. 

2. The service represents or creates an asset, in which all nodes have some stake.

3. The nodes share the common goal of running the service but do not necessarily 
   trust each other for more. 

....

5. On the other hand, blockchains in the “permissioned” model control who participates in validation and
   in the protocol; these nodes typically have established identities and form a consortium

Consensus protocol is pluggable, currently an implementation of Byzantine fault-tolerant con-
sensus using the PBFT protocol.

  * Assets over cryptocurrency
  * Identity over anonymity
  * Selective endorsement (consensus) over proof of work

## Hyperledger, Blockchain and the IBM Blockchain Platform

[Hyperledger](http://hyperledger.org/) is an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools, started in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation, to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers.
