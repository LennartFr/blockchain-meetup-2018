# How did it all start?

October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:

<i>A blockchain is a decentralized virtual ledger for recording transactions without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. It is made up of three technologies 

1. cryptographic algorithms, 
1. a distributed protocol, 
1. and replicated data 
<p>
which combined provide a trustworthy service to a group of nodes that do not fully trust each other. 
<p>
With blockchain, several users can write entries into a block or a record of information, and a community can control how the record of information is modified and updated.
</i>
Consensus protocol is pluggable, currently an implementation of Byzantine fault-tolerant con-
sensus using the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) protocol.
